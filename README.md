# Grade 11 ISU (ICS3U1)

_**Made by Christian Fisla and Cyrus Choi**_

**Responsibilities of each Person**    

Cyrus: 
- Initialized rectangle array for all ghosts and towers
- Made and implemented click for title screen, about us and How to Play
- Coded updateBullet array where the bullets are supposed to move in the direction of the ghosts
- Coded part of moveEnemy array to move the enemy along a certain path on the X and Y axis
- Wrote handleAction array to run certain chunks of code based on where the user has clicked
- Initialized background music

Christian: 
- Found a way to include multiple images at once (using buffered image)
- Initialized our FPS counter
- Set angles and slope to rotate tower turret

**Missing Functionalities**
- Missing other levels
- Aimed for multiple towers and upgrade options
- Instead of array to set int values to, instead we used rectangle arrays to draw all the towers

**Additional Functionalities**
- Made the tower turret rotate to track each enemy
- Added click sound

**Known bugs / Errors**
- 

**Other important Information**
- Although this program is very different from what we originally imagined we could do in our time constraint, we hope you still enjoy playing level 1
